1) What is Docker Container?
A Docker Container is a form of encapsulation to the application which holds all the dependencies which share the kernel with other 
containers in the duration of running the isolated processes on the host operating system

2) What is Dockerfile used for?
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 
Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

3) Virtual Machines vs Docker Containers
Need more resources	
Less resources are used

Process isolation is done at hardware level	
Process Isolation is done at Operating System level

Separate Operating System for each VM	
Operating System resources can be shared within Docker

VMs can be customized.	
Custom container setup is easy

Takes time to create Virtual Machine	
Creation of docker is very quick

Booting takes minutes	
Booting is done within seconds

4) What is the advantage of Docker over hypervisors?
Docker is light weight and more efficient in terms of resource uses because it uses the host underlying kernel rather 4
than creating its own hypervisor.

5) How do I run multiple copies of a Compose file on the same host?
Docker’s compose makes use of the Project name to create unique identifiers for all of the project’s containers 
and resources. In order to run multiple copies of the same project, you will need to set a custom project name 
using the –p command line option or you could use the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable for this purpose.

6) Is there a way to identify the status of a Docker container?
We can identify the status of a Docker container by running the command ‘docker ps –a’, which will in turn list down all
the available docker containers with its corresponding statuses on the host. 
From there we can easily identify the container of interest to check its status correspondingly.

7) Difference between Docker Image and container?
Docker container is the runtime instance of docker image.
Docker Image doesnot have a state and its state never changes as it is just set of files whereas docker 
container has its execution state.
