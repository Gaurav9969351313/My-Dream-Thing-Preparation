1) What is Anonymous function?
An Anonymous function is a special function which does not have any name. 
We just define their parameters and define the code into the curly braces.
delegate int func(int a, int b);
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    func f1 = delegate(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    };

    Console.WriteLine(f1(1, 2));
}

Explain what is “LINQ to Objects”?
When LINQ queries any IEnumerable(<T>) collection or IEnumerable directly without the use of an 
intermediate LINQ provider or API such as LINQ to SQL or LINQ to XML is referred as LINQ to Objects.
